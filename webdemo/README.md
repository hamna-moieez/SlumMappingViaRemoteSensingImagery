### Credits
The training code is taken from: <a href="https://github.com/cbsudux/Mumbai-slum-segmentation/tree/master/slums">HERE</a>, please refer to this for the original code. I built the web demo on top of that using flask. This folder contains the entire code with exception of the trained model, which can be downloaded from the given link (re-produced from the original repo).
